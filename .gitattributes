# Handle the Line Endings in git correctly
# see: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#per-repository-settings
#
# Set the default behavior, if Git thinks a file is text (as opposed to binary), 
# also in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout. E.g.,
#*.c text

# Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout.
*.py text eol=lf
*.azcli text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
Jenkinsfile text eol=lf

# Denote all files that should not have line endings normalized, should not be
# merged, and should not show in a textual diff.
